Updated version of software including optical wave similarity and dFdt mapping. See below for more details on methodology. 
Setting are available from top menu. Setting dFdt level to 0 will map maximum dFdt. 
Setting OWS threshold to zero will calculate OWS, setting to any other value will calculate regularity index.
